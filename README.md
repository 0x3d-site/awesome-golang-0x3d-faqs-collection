### 96. How do I handle errors in Golang?

`In Golang, error handling is explicit. Functions typically return an error value as the last return. Check this value to handle errors gracefully using `if` statements.`

Brief: Error handling in Golang is a fundamental aspect of writing robust applications. Unlike many languages that use exceptions, Go promotes explicit error handling, requiring developers to check error values returned by functions. This guide will delve into the principles of error handling in Go and provide examples of best practices.
